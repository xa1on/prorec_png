[prerecs](https://github.com/gmzorz/prerecs), but for image sequences.

I recommend using [prorecs](https://github.com/xa1on/prorecs/releases) if you are not dealing with image sequences.

### Features

* Image sequence to video encoding
* FFmpeg supported codec usage
* Source framerate adjustment
* Drag n Drop support
* Customizable ffmpeg arguments
* Multi-folder encoding

### Usage

Drag the folder containing your image sequences. Keep each image sequence in different folders.

After the encoding process, your encoded video should be alongside the image sequence folders.

View example in the sample_recording folder.
